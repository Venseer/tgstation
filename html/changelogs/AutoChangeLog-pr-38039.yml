  - rscadd: "Love potions are marginally more interesting! This same effect applies to if you are a valentine!"
  - tweak: "The names of extracts are now in the proper order, finally!"
  - rscadd: "Self-sustaining extracts are in! Technically, this is a fix, but whatever."
  - bugfix: "Stabilized Cerulean extracts no longer vaporize items into the Aetherium."
  - rscadd: "Stabilized Gold extracts are now moderately more fun to use! The randomized creature persists if it is killed, and can be rerolled at will! Also, if you give the creature a sentience potion, the mind will transfer over!"
